# JobList
Quick and dirty WPF program to create a random chores list for children

This was mostly an exercise in properly creating a WPF application by modifying the xaml, rather then dragging and dropping the elements
individually.  Will create a job list, assigning jobs at random from a pre-made list to each child.  It will come in the form of a text file
that is specifically named for the date it was created on (useful for a potential metrics addon later to see which child is doing their 
chores more commonly then others).  The file is created in a hardcoded place as the application was not meant to be used on any machine
other then my own.
